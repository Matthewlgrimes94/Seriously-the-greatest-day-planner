## Seriously-the-greatest-day-planner

* A day planner, that shows you what time it is, and lets you place text into the time blocks, so that you can oranize your day! The text is saved to loccal storage when you hit the save icon associated with the text input! The day planner also shows you which hours of the day you still have left to go, by turning them green! If the current hour matches one of the hours on the planner, it will be blue!

* I used the moment.js library to handle time!

* I used the bootstrap CSS library for styling!
* https://getbootstrap.com/

* I also used font Awesome for the save icons!
* https://fontawesome.com/
